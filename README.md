## Instructions
1) You are given a JSON file with an array of Objects. Every element can be grouped together using the "type" property.
2) Your job is to import the data and arrange them in a way that the elements are evenly distributed.
3) You then have to create a server using node.js(micro or express) and serve this distribution upon request.
4) Create a frontend using either VanillaJS, React, Angular, Vue or Hyperapp that consumes this distribution and colors all the elements with similar type. For Example, if I click "typeA", it should color all the positions that this type exists at.
5) Provide buttons on the UI for each type so we can toggle between types.
6) Sample pictures are in the "outputExamples" folder.
7) You can display the distribution in any similar way possible (get creative). Visualization is upto you (you can use libraries like D3.js).
8) Please add references to all the mathematical formulas or theorms used to achieve these results.
9) If you come up with your own algorithm please explain in brief how, why and when for the algorithm.
10) Create a branch from master and pull request when you're done.
11) Reach out to us if you have any questions and inform us when you're done.
12) Place the Frontend in the root folder "static".
13) Update the README.md file with the instructions on how to test the app.

## Bonus Points
1) If you deploy this app on a cloud(preferably on AWS).

## Notes
1) The output images are just the example visualizations we are expecting to see when we click a type
2) Output images do not necessarily represent even distribution
